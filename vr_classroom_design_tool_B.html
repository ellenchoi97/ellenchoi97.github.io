        <p>
            This project was the third assignment for UCSD's 3D User Interation class and a continuation of the previous assignment 
            (<a href="vr_classroom_design_tool_A.html">VR Classroom Design Tool - Selection and Manipulation</a>). This part of the project 
            invovles implementing two different travel methods, teleportation with ray casting and continuous movement (walk mode).

            <p>Goals for this Project:</p>

            <ol>
                <li>Implement a teleportation mode. Display a ray emanating from the right hand controller and an indicator on the floor to allow the user to point to their destination.</li>
                <li>The teleportation mode changes the user's position immediately, and their orientation stays the same.</li>
                <li>Implement a walk mode where the user is always on the floor, moves gradually, and they can only rotate around the y (up) axis.</li>
                <li>
                    The speed of the motion in walk mode is gradually adjustable depending on the distance of the right hand's controller from its original position.
                    The same applies to changing the user's orientation.
                </li>
                <li>Add a visual display to the left hand controller to indicate which mode is active.</li>
            </ol>

            <p>Controls:</p>

            <ul>
                <li>Left Hand Trigger: Toggle between teleport and walk mode</li>
                <li>Right Hand Trigger: Teleport to the indicated location if in teleport mode, hold and move or turn the controller to walk around the room</li>
            </ul>
