            This project was the second assignment for UCSD's 3D User Interation class. The program is an application that helps the user
            design the layout of the classroom by spawning chairs and desks. The project invovles implementing object selection and
            manipulation using ray casting.

            <p>Goals for this Project:</p>

            <ol>
                <li>Display a ray emanating from the user's right hand controller, pointing forward like a laser pointer.</li>
                <li>When the spawn button(A/B) is pressed, an instance of a desk or chair is created.</li>
                <li>While the user holds down a spawn button, the desk/chair remains on the ray so that it can be positioned and oriented as desired.</li>
                <li>When a spawn button is released, the desk/chair falls down and comes to rest on the floor or on another piece of furniture.</li>
                <li>Implement ray casting to select a desk/chair in the room. Highlight the selected piece of furniture.</li>
                <li>When the trigger button is released, the physics engine makes the furniture should fall down as it does when it is spawned.</li>
            </ol>

            <p>Controls:</p>

            <ul>
                <li>A: Spawn a chair at a distance from the user's hand on the ray</li>
                <li>B: Spawn a desk at a distance from the user's hand on the ray</li>
                <li>Right Hand Trigger: Hold to move and orient the selected furniture</li>
            </ul>
