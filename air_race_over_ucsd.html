            This project was the fourth assignment for UCSD's 3D User Interation class and it was a program where the user is inside an "aircraft" and they must control the
            aircraft to reach all the checkpoints of the given race track. The purpose of the project was to become familiar with coding with the Leap Motion,
            implementing efficient controls using the Leap Motion, and implementing wayfinding methods.

            <p>Goals for this Project:</p>

            <ol>
                <li>Write a parser to get the coordinates for the checkpoints for the race track and create a visual representation of the track by drawing the checkpoints.</li>
                <li>A checkpoint is reached when the aircraft collides with the checkpoint. Implement a visual indication that a checkpoint has been reached (different colored checkpoints).</li>
                <li>Start at the first checkpoint. Display a countdown timer and do not allow the aircraft to move until the countdown ends.</li>
                <li>Display a stopwatch once the countdown ends. Stop the stopwatch when all checkpoints have been reached in order.</li>
                <li>
                    Implement controls for the aircraft using only data from the Leap Motion.
                    <ul>
                        <li>The aircraft cannot teleport anywhere but it may stop and start instantaneously.</li>
                        <li>Auto pilot is not allowed.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>Implement two different visual methods for wayfinding (arrow indicator and text showing distance remaining).</li>
                <li>Display the wayfinding visuals in different coordinate spaces (aircraft coordinates and head/Oculus Rift's coordinates).</li>

                <li>If the aircraft collides with the floor or a building, move back to the last successfully cleared checkpoint. Implement a countdown before the aircraft can move again.</li>
            </ol>

            <p>Aircraft Controls:</p>

            <ul>
                <li>Thumb Up (Left): Turn to the left</li>
                <li>Thumb Up (Right): Turn to the right</li>
                <li>Palm Up (Left or Right, not Both): Move up</li>
                <li>Palm Down (Left or Right, not Both): Move down</li>
                <li>Fist (Left, Right, or Both): Move forward</li>
                <li>Index Finger Extended (Left, Right, or Both): Move backward</li>
            </ul>

            <p>
                * Movements can be combined (ex. left thumb up and right palm up lets the user move up and turn left) <br />
                * If the user has a fist in one hand and an extended index finger in the other, no movement will occur (Cannot move forward and backward).
