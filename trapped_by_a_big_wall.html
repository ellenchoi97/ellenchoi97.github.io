            This project was the first assignment for UCSD's 3D User Interation class and was created in collaboration with another student.
            The purpose of this project was to get familiar with using Unity/C# and creating a VR application with an Oculus Rift headset.
            This project involved implementing object selection and manipulation with visual indicators and physics simulation.

                <a href="http://ivl.calit2.net/wiki/index.php/Project1W19">Project Rubric and Directions</a>

                <ol>
                    <li>Create a textured plane to represent the ground.</li>
                    <li>Procedurally generate a cylindrical wall of bricks. Add a texture and apply realistic physics properties to the bricks.</li>
                    <li>
                        When the user stares at a brick for at least 2 seconds, allow the user to control the brick.
                        <ul>
                            <li>Depending on the user's head movement, the brick will move towards the outside or the inside of the wall.</li>
                            <li>The brick moves parallel to the axis of the radius of the brick cylinder.</li>
                            <li>The physics simulation makes the bricks above a removed brick tumble down.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>Highlight the brick that is being looked at.</li>
                    <li>Reset the wall when the user looks up to the sky.</li>
                    <li>When the user stares at a brick for at least 7 seconds, explode the brick.</li>
                    <li>Add a radial widget to indicate how much longer the user must stare at a brick to activate movement and explosion.</li>
